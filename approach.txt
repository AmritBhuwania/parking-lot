Approach/Though process of why certain things were designed/coded in the way they are:

1. A singletion class for parking lot(the main class) so that the instantiation of a class happens only once and all the object orchaestration happens ideally through it.

2. Used 3 maps for each of the three requirements/queries

3. Used a list of car which contains all the car objects parked at a given instant of time.

4. Have modified the hashcode and equals methods for specific usage of duplicacy check(No 2 cars will ideally have same registration num even if the color is different)

5. Use of a static boolean `isParkingLotCreated` which helps in determing if the parking lot is already created.

6. Use of static integer `ticketNum` so that the ticket numbers are always assigned incrementally and no 2 cars are assigned same ticket at any point of time. 

7. Handled edge cases.
